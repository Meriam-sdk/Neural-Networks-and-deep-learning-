# Neural Network Coursework

This project is a coursework assignment focused on implementing and training neural networks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It demonstrates the use of PyTorch for data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes transformations such as random cropping, horizontal flipping, and normalization for data augmentation.
- **Dataset:** Utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset for training and testing.
- **Deep Learning Framework:** Built with PyTorch for flexibility and ease of use.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook NN_coursework.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Import necessary libraries.
   - Download and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
   - Train and evaluate the neural network.

## Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** Defines transformations for the training and testing datasets.
- **Dataset Loading:** Downloads and loads CIFAR-10 data using PyTorch's `torchvision.datasets`.
- **Model Training:** (Include specific details if further cells define model architecture or training loops).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- PyTorch 1.9 or later
- torchvision
- numpy
